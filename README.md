# Magnetic-Tracking-Project
This repository contains all of the code used in my Masters thesis titled ‘Development of a 3D Magnetic Tracking System for Spatial Registration of Neuroimaging Devices’. 
The base code folder contains the functional toolkit built to control an automated magnetic platform. 
The investigations folder contains all of the data used for my thesis and should be read in conjunction with my dissertation and supporting documents.
